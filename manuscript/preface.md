## About this book
This book is written as a companion book to the
[Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/regmods)
Coursera class as part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=courseDescripTop). However, if you do not take the class, the book mostly stands on its own. A
useful component of the book is a series of [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpl-gQkQivXjqHAJd2t-J_One_fYE55tC) that comprise the
Coursera class.

The book is intended to be a low cost introduction to the important field of
regression models. The intended audience are students who are numerically
and computationally literate, who would like to put those skills to use in
Data Science or Statistics. The book is offered for free as a series of
markdown documents on github and in more convenient forms (epub, mobi) on
LeanPub.

## About the cover
The picture on the cover is a public domain image taken from
Francis Galton's paper on hereditary stature. It represents
an important leap in the development of regression and
correlation as well as regression to the mean.
