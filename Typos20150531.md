# Regression Models Typos 20150531

Dear Professor Caffo,

Thank you for offering wonderful courses and books. I have found some typos that need your attention:


### Before beginning

The entirety of the book is on GitHub here. Please submit pull requests if you find errata! In addition the course notes can be found also on GitHub here. While most code is in the book, all of the code for every figure and analysis in the book is in the R markdown **files files** (.Rmd) for the respective lectures.


### Exploratory analysis of Galton's Data

You may need to run install.packages("UsingR") if the UsingR library is not installed. Let's look at the marginal (parents disregarding children and children disregarding parents) distributions first. Parent distribution is all heterosexual couples. The parental average corrected for gender via multiplying female heights by 1.08. Remember, Galton didn't have regression to help figure out a **betetr** way to do this correction! It's also worth noting that overplotting is an issue from discretization of the heights.


### Using regression for prediction

Let's visualize our prediction. In the following plot, the predicted values at the observed Xs are the red points on the fitted line. The new X values are **the at** vertical lines, which are connected to the predicted values via the connected horizontal lines.


Hope it help. 

All the best!
